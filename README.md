This repository was created for the [Computer Vision Nanodegree ](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) at [Udacity](https://Udacity.com).

## Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection

In this project, I build a facial keypoint detection system. The system consists of a face detector that uses Haar Cascades and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predict the facial keypoints in the detected faces.

## Project 2: Image Captioning
In this project, I design a CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) model for  automatically generating image captions.
