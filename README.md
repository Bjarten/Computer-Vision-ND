This repository was created for the [Computer Vision Nanodegree ](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) at [Udacity](https://Udacity.com).

## Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection

In this project, I build a facial keypoint detection system. The system consists of a face detector that uses Haar Cascades and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predict the facial keypoints in the detected faces.

A complete project description can be found in the Udacity repository for this project: [P1_Facial_Keypoints](https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints)
